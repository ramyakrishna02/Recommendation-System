# Recommendation System
A recommendation system is an algorithm that suggests relevant items to the users. It is a subclass of Information filtering Systems that seeks to predict the rating or the preference a user might give to an item. 

It uses Big Data to suggest or recommend additional products to consumers based on various criteria, including past purchases, search history, demographic information, and other factors. 

Recommendation systems work by collecting customer data and auto-analyzing it to generate customized recommendations for your customers. These systems rely on both implicit data, such as browsing history and past purchases, and explicit data, such as ratings provided by the user. The recommender function is an important component of any of these systems which takes information about the user and predicts the rating that user might assign to a product.

There are many use-cases of recommendation systems such as personalized content, better product search experience and more. There are different types of recommendation systems such as Content-Based Filtering.
